<h2>Rationale</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>top-down rendering</strong> of components (<em>unidirectional</em> data flow)</li>
<li>favors <strong>immutable</strong> data (with Immutable.js)</li>
<li>encourages <strong>small, composable components</strong>, and <strong>shared functionality</strong> through mixins</li>
<li><strong>Seperation of concern.</strong> Components only deal with their own piece of data</li>
<li>components can only <strong>change their own data</strong>, via <em>cursors</em> (without knowing where their data resides in the outer immutable data structure)</li>
<li>easily listen for changes <strong>across your data structure</strong> and trigger re-render</li>
<li>immutable data can give even <strong>faster re-renders</strong> than with pure React, as React can be prevented from even considering to re-render component trees with unchanged data</li>
<li><strong>efficient, centrally</strong> defined shouldComponentUpdate</li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Usage</h2>

In its simplest form, an Omniscient component very much resembles a React component, however, its primary focus is on content. Components take props that are easily accessible as parameters of the component's render function.

<div class='window'>
  <div class='inner inner--code'>
<textarea class='editor'>
var Greet = component(({name}) =>
  <div>Hello from {name}!</div>);

React.render(
  Greet({ name: 'Omniscient' }),
  document.getElementById('result-1'));</textarea>
  </div>
  <div id='result-1' class='inner inner--result'></div>
</div>

The code below shows Omniscient used in cooperation with Immstruct and the cursors of Immutable.js - a "render loop" pattern you'll often see with Omniscient apps. Whenever the data of an Immstruct instance changes, an event is fired and React can be told to re-render your application. When using immutable data structures, Omniscient will take care to only re-render the parts of your application who's data actually changed. As components receive cursors that point into these immutable data structures, each component can easily update its own data without knowledge of the other parts of the data structure.

<div class='window'>
  <div class='inner inner--code'>
<textarea class='editor'>
var Count = component(({counter}) =>
  <div>
    <span>Count {counter.deref()}! </span>
    <button onClick={() => counter.update(n => n + 1)}>inc</button>
    <button onClick={() => counter.update(n => n - 1)}>dec</button>
  </div>);

var data = immstruct({ counter: 42 });
data.on('swap', render);
render();

function render () {
  React.render(
    Count({ counter: data.cursor('counter') }),
    document.getElementById('result-2'));
}

setInterval(
  () => data.cursor('counter').update(i => i + 1),
  2000);
</textarea>
  </div>
  <div id='result-2' class='inner inner--result'></div>
</div>

Immstruct along with Immutable.js is a perfect fit for your Omniscient apps.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
Omniscient is just as much a way to think when you are building applications as a library it self. In essense, Omniscient
is a small layer of syntactic sugar on top of React as well as an implemented <code class="javascript">shouldComponentUpdate</code>, optimized for use with immutable data and the architectural style of Omniscient.
</p>
<p>
If you are totally new to Omniscient, or even React, you can get started by reading the article <a href="https://github.com/omniscientjs/omniscient/wiki/Simpler-UI-Reasoning-with-Unidirectional-Dataflow-and-Immutable-Data">Simpler UI Reasoning with Unidirectional Dataflow and Immutable Data</a>. This is an introductory article which explains the concepts and benefits of immutable data and cursors, and also why Omniscient is worth trying out. If you prefer to see code instead of reading, you can see the obligatory example <a href="https://github.com/jcranendonk/todomvc-omniscient/">TodoMVC</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jcranendonk">@jcranendonk</a>.

<h3>Download and Use</h3>
<p>
You can download Omniscient through NPM or CDN. The easiest way is to use NPM:
</p>

<div class="window window--code">
  <pre><code class="shell">npm install --save omniscient</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Or you can include the code through a CDN. Remember to also include React in your project.
</p>

<div class="window window--code">
  <pre><code class="html">&lt;script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/omniscient/{{site.version}}/omniscient.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/omniscient/{{site.version}}/omniscient.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>As Omniscient is wrapped in a UMD you can use it many different ways, through CommonJS, AMD or just through the window-object</p>

<div class="window window--code">
  <pre><code class="js">// Common.js (recommended)

var component = require('omniscient');

// or AMD:
require(['omniscient'], function (component) {
  // do something with component
});


// or as fallback Window-object:
var component = window.Omniscient;
</code></pre>
</div>

<script src="scripts/vendor/script.min.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/runnable-scripts.js"></script>
