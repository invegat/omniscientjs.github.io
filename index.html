<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
      <div class="window">
        <div class="control">
          <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>

        <div class="inner inner--result">
          <div>Hello Omniscient</div>
        </div>
        <div class="inner inner--code">
<pre><code class="js">var component = require('omniscient');
var Hello = component((props) => &lt;div&gt;Hello {props.name}&lt;/div&gt;);
React.render(Hello({ name: 'Omniscient' }), document.body);</code></pre>
        </div>

      </div>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        Omniscient is just as much a way to think when you are building applications, as a library it self. In essense, Omniscient
        is a small layer of syntactic sugar on top of React (for guiding usage) as well as a implemented <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>,
        which is optimized for usage with immutable data and the architectural style of Omniscient.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are totally new to Omniscient (and React), you can get started by reading the article <a href="https://github.com/omniscientjs/omniscient/wiki/Simpler-UI-Reasoning-with-Unidirectional-Dataflow-and-Immutable-Data">Simpler UI Reasoning with Unidirectional Dataflow and Immutable Data</a>.
        This is an introductory article which explains some of the concepts of immutable data, cursors and
        why Omniscient is worth trying out. If you prefer to see code instead of reading, you can see the obligatory example <a href="https://github.com/jcranendonk/todomvc-omniscient/">TodoMVC</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jcranendonk">@jcranendonk</a>.

      <h3>Download and Use</h3>
      <p>
        You can download Omniscient through NPM, Bower or CDN. The easiest way, and will better share dependencies, is to use NPM:
      </p>

      <div class="window window--code">
<pre><code class="shell">npm install --save omniscient</code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        Or you can include the code through a CDN. Remember to also have React in your project.
      </p>

      <div class="window window--code">
<pre><code class="html">&lt;script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/omniscient/2.1.0/omniscient.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/omniscient/2.1.0/omniscient.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
      </div>


      <p>As Omniscient is wrapped in a UMD, you can use it many different ways, through CommonJS, AMD or just through the window-object:</p>

      <div class="window window--code">
<pre><code class="js">// Common.js (recommended)

var component = require('omniscient');

// or AMD:
require(['omniscient'], function (component) {
  // do something with component
});


// or as fallback Window-object:
var component = window.Omniscient;
</code></pre>
      </div>
