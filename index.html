<h2>Rationale</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>functional programming</strong> for UIs</li>
  <li><strong>memoization for stateless React components</strong></li>
  <li><strong>top-down rendering</strong> of components (unidirectional data flow)</li>
  <li><strong>favors immutable data</strong> (with Immutable.js)</li>
  <li>encourages <strong>small, composable components</strong>, and shared functionality through mixins</li>
  <li><strong>natural separation of concern</strong>. Components only deal with their own piece of data</li>
  <li><strong>efficient</strong>, centrally defined shouldComponentUpdate</li>
</ul>


<h2>Basic Usage</h2>

<p>
  In its simplest form, an Omniscient component is a Stateless React Component, but more optimized with a smart predefined <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code>.
  Much like memoization would be for a Febonacci function.
</p>

<div class="editor"><textarea>
var Greet = component(({name}) =>
  <div>Hello from {name}!</div>);

React.render(
  Greet({ name: 'Omniscient' }),
  el);</textarea></div>

<p>The code below shows Omniscient used in cooperation with <a href="https://github.com/omniscientjs/immstruct/blob/master/README.md">
  Immstruct</a> and the cursors of <a href="https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/tree/master/contrib/cursor">Immutable.js</a>
  - a "render loop" pattern you'll often see with Omniscient apps. Whenever the data of an Immstruct instance changes, an event is fired and React can be told to re-render your application. When using immutable data structures, Omniscient will take care to only re-render the parts of your application which data actually changed. As components receive cursors that point into these immutable data structures, each component can easily update its own data without knowledge of the other parts of the data structure.</p>


<div class="editor"><textarea>
var Count = component(({counter}) =>
  <div>
    <span>Count {counter.deref()}! </span>
    <button onClick={() => counter.update(n => n + 1)}>inc</button>
    <button onClick={() => counter.update(n => n - 1)}>dec</button>
  </div>);

var data = immstruct({ counter: 42 });
data.on('swap', render);
render();

function render () {
  React.render(
    Count({ counter: data.cursor('counter') }),
    el);
}

setInterval(
  () => data.cursor('counter').update(i => i + 1),
  2000);</textarea></div>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>
  Omniscient is just as much a way to think when you are building applications as a library it self. In essense, Omniscient
  is a small layer of syntactic sugar on top of React as well as an implemented <code class="javascript">shouldComponentUpdate</code>, optimized for use with immutable data and the architectural style of Omniscient.
</p>
<p>
  If you are totally new to Omniscient, or even React, you can get started by reading the article
  <a href="http://omniscientjs.github.io/guides/01-simpler-ui-reasoning-with-unidirectional/">Simpler UI Reasoning with Unidirectional Dataflow and Immutable Data</a>.
  This is an introductory article which explains the concepts and benefits of immutable data and cursors,
  and also why Omniscient is worth trying out. If you prefer to see code instead of reading, you
  can see the obligatory example <a href="https://github.com/jcranendonk/todomvc-omniscient/">TodoMVC</a> by
  <a href="https://github.com/jcranendonk">@jcranendonk</a>.

<h3>Download and Use</h3>
<p>
You can download Omniscient through NPM or CDN. The easiest way is to use NPM:
</p>

<div class="window window--code">
  <pre><code class="shell">npm install --save omniscient</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Or you can include the code through a CDN. Remember to also include React in your project.
</p>

<div class="window window--code">
  <pre><code class="html">&lt;script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/omniscient/{{site.version}}/omniscient.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/omniscient/{{site.version}}/omniscient.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>As Omniscient is wrapped in a UMD you can use it many different ways, through CommonJS, AMD or just through the window object:</p>

<div class="window window--code">
  <pre><code class="js">// Common.js (recommended)

var component = require('omniscient');

// or AMD:
require(['omniscient'], function (component) {
  // do something with component
});

// or as fallback Window-object:
var component = window.omniscient;
</code></pre>
</div>
